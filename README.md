The code should read a list of number pairs represetating closed ranges from a file called 'ranges.txt'. 
It also should read a list of point, namely, 'points.dat'. 
The function is to find the number of ranges that contain each point. For an example, a point A is contained inside the interval [X,Y] if X<=A<=Y. The output should maintain the same ordering as the input points (points.dat).
